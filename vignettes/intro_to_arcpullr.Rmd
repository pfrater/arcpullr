The `arcpullr` package provides functions for pulling spatial data from 
an ArcGIS REST API and formatting those layers into `sf` objects. These 
functions provide the basis for querying data housed in a spatial REST API in both a spatial and relational manner.

\
\
\
\

# The `get_spatial_layer()` function

This function is the core of the package, and allows users to pull data from an 
ArcGIS REST API

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# url <- some url from an ArcGIS REST API layer
layer <- get_spatial_layer(url)
```

The URL should be a specific layer from an ArcGIS REST API, such as the 
[Wisconsin Dep't. of Natural Resources Hi-cap well layer](https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/arcgis/rest/services/DG_HiCap/DG_HICAP_REVIEW_WTM_INT/MapServer/0), for example.

The `get_spatial_layer()` function will retrieve data from this layer, and format
it to an object of class sf (*i.e.* of the R package sf: Simple Features for R).

This function is also query-able both using both SQL code and ArcGIS's 
[Query (Feature Service)](
https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/query-feature-service-.htm
) functionality. To query via SQL within the function the field name for the 
query of interest must be known. For example,

### Querying via SQL

```{r, warning = FALSE}
wdnr_base_url <- "https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/arcgis/rest/services"
service_url <- "WT_SWDV"
open_water_layer_url <- "WT_Inland_Water_Resources_WTM_Ext_v2/MapServer/3"
hydro_url <- paste(wdnr_base_url, service_url, open_water_layer_url, sep = "/")
wi_river <- get_spatial_layer(hydro_url, 
  where = "WATERBODY_ROW_NAME = 'Wisconsin River'"
)
```

For multiple WHERE clauses there is a helper function to string them together
properly. This can be called to the where argument above in place of a text 
string.

```{r}
sql_where(ROW_WATERBODY_NAME = 'Wisconsin River', HYDROCODE = 7011)
```

### Querying Spatially via ArcGIS Feature Service

Along with SQL, layers from an ArcGIS REST API may be queried spatially. This
is accomplished with the `get_layer_by_*` family of functions. These functions
are essentially a wrapper around `get_spatial_layer` that removes the 
abstraction of the spatial query syntax query by ArcGIS. These functions 
require a spatial object of class `sf` to be passed to the `geometry` argument.
To test this out you can also quickly create simple `sf` objects using
`sf_lines()`, `sf_points()`, or `sf_polygons()` to test out the service feature.

```{r}
streams_layer_url <- "WT_Inland_Water_Resources_WTM_Ext_v2/MapServer/2"
streams_url <- paste(wdnr_base_url, service_url, streams_layer_url, sep = "/")
mke_waters <- get_layer_by_poly(url = streams_url, mke_county)
```

Spatial queries can be done with polygons, lines, or points...just use the 
respective `get_layer_by_*` function.

### Plotting Layers

The retrieved layers may be plotted in whatever way you like to plot `sf` 
objects. For quick plots to check if your query worked we've included the 
`plot_layer` function, which uses either `ggplot2` (default) to plot the layer
or can be switched to base graphics.

```{r}
plot_layer(mke_waters)
plot_layer(wi_river, outline = wis_poly)
```
